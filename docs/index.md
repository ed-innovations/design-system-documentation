# Design System

This repository contains a small, ready-to-use design system built with:

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **Plain CSS**

The goal of this design system is to provide **ready-to-use UI components**
that you can **copy, tweak, and compose quickly** while keeping
a consistent visual style.

---

## Philosophy

- Components are **self-contained**
- Styling is **explicit and readable**
- No heavy abstractions
- No external UI libraries
- Optimized for **speed, and clarity**
